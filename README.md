## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years.

As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze booking patterns and seasonality.
- Identify top revenue-generating segments.
- Explore customer demographics and booking behaviors.
- Provide actionable insights for revenue optimization.
